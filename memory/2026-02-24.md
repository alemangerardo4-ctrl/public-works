## Afternoon session (2026-02-24)
- Calendar widget live + recurring 9am event created ✅
- Figma MCP: PAT verified (Gerardo Aleman / alemangerardo4), file rSYVMRPNm0yPTS4dhusfuY connected, MCP server wired, rate limit hit during testing
- Shopify: long auth journey — Dev Dashboard uses OAuth not static tokens. CLI logged in as alemangerardo4@gmail.com. App (client_id c807c92f...) created under a different Partner org = mismatch. Need to either create new app under alemangerardo4 org OR re-auth CLI with the Partner org email.
- MC live URL: https://mc-dashboard-puce.vercel.app
- Sprint 1 doc uploaded to Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IxybPJCQPs2F16zLyj2eJWYepI19I85h/view

## Late Evening (11pm) — FRONTIER WORKFLOW RESEARCH + VERCEL STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH (2025/2026 Leaders)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Figma → Code Automation (Frontier):**
- Tokens Studio plugin (Figma Variables → JSON exports)
- AI-powered linting bots (scan naming, duplicates, accessibility)
- CI/CD automation (every design change triggers code generation)
- Zero manual exports — fully atomic pipeline
- Sources: Into Design Systems 2025, Design Systems Collective

**Discord Orchestration (Frontier):**
- Slash commands trigger deploys (/deploy, /create-task)
- Modal forms capture requirements → auto-create tasks
- Real-time agent feedback loops
- Webhook cascades (Figma → Discord → code review → deploy)
- Lives as command center + audit trail

**Vercel + Shopify Pipeline (Frontier):**
- GitHub Actions auto-deploy (not manual CLI)
- Design → Code → Shopify product page (atomic flow)
- Image automation (Figma → Shopify, no re-upload)
- Inventory bidirectional sync
- Analytics → MC Dashboard (real-time revenue/conversion)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 ROADMAP: TODAY vs FRONTIER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TODAY:
→ Manual Figma copy/paste to Tailwind
→ Discord = communication only
→ Vercel CLI manual deploys

FRONTIER (90-day plan):
Week 1: Figma Design System (Variables) + GitHub Actions auto-deploy
Week 2-3: Discord slash commands + modal workflows + MC webhooks
Week 4+: Agent feedback loops + real-time sync + image automation
Month 2-3: Full atomic pipeline (design → live)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Issue: Git author "your-email@example.com" lacks team permissions on Vercel

- public-works: Last push 2026-02-24 20:29, NOT deployed yet
- mc-dashboard: Latest deployed 26m ago (live)

Solution: GitHub Actions auto-deploy workflow (replace manual Vercel CLI)
- Trigger: Push to main branch
- Action: Install → build → deploy to Vercel
- No manual intervention needed

Status: Queued for implementation (Winston priority Feb 25)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🤖 DISCORD CHANNELS STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
8 channels queued for auto-creation:
- #general, #missions, #aleman-engineer, #public-works
- #dev-sprints, #design-feedback, #deployments, #wins

Bot restart triggers creation (scheduled Feb 25)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Feb 25)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Gerardo:
1. Build Figma Design System (Variables + 5 frames: Colors, Typography, Spacing, Components, Export)
2. Install Tokens Studio plugin

Key insight: We're not chasing trends for ego. We're building the exact pipeline that scales 1→100 people. Every layer compounds. Stay ahead of the frontier.

## Late Late Evening (11:15pm) — OVERNIGHT RESEARCH + BRIEF DELIVERY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 FRONTIER FIGMA WORKFLOW RESEARCH (For Feb 25 fresh start)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Created: FIGMA-WORKFLOW-RESEARCH.md (comprehensive guide)

**2026 Best Practice Stack:**
- Figma Make (rough idea → prototype in 5min, AI-powered)
- Figma Variables + Modes (light/dark/high-contrast auto-generated)
- Tokens Studio plugin (auto-export to JSON/CSS/Tailwind)
- Design Lint (auto-validate naming, accessibility, orphaned)
- Custom API bridge (Figma → GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy)

**Key Intel:**
- Fastest iteration: 30sec token change → live (vs 15min today)
- No manual export/paste workflow anymore
- AI validation running continuously
- Design → code fully atomic
