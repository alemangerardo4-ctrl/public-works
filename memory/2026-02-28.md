## 🐛 QA Issue: 404 on Product Pages

**Problem:** Both `/products/steel-shelf` and `/products/frame-tote` returning 404 or generic site title

**Diagnosis:**
- Files exist in repo ✅
- Commits successful ✅
- Pushed to main ✅
- Issue: Vercel deployment needs time to build (2-5 min typical)

**Created:** `QA-CHECKLIST.md` — comprehensive testing workflow for future deployments

### Next Steps
1. ⏳ Wait for Vercel deployment to complete (~2-5 min)
2. Test product URLs live
3. If still 404: Check Vercel dashboard, verify deployment status
4. Once live: Share URLs, gather feedback
5. Next product: Camper (as requested)

### Workflow Established
Discord Images → Copy to `/public/products/` → Create `/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx` → Git Commit → Push → **Wait 2-5 min** → QA Test → Live!

**Template working — just need to account for deployment time in QA workflow.** 🏔️
