### Medium Description (Social Media)
The Frame Tote isn't just another bag — it's a load-bearing system disguised as everyday carry.

An internal aluminum frame distributes weight across your shoulders and back, making heavy loads feel manageable whether you're hauling tools, groceries, or camping gear.

Waxed organic cotton canvas sheds water and dirt. Reinforced stitching at stress points. Modular webbing loops for accessories.

**Lifetime warranty.** If it breaks, we fix it or replace it. No questions asked.

- Load capacity: 30lb (13.6kg)

This is the future of truck campers: open-source, DIY, and affordable.

Commercial pop-up campers cost $8,000-$15,000. They're heavy, proprietary, and impossible to customize. We took a different approach: give you the engineering, the parts, the CAD files, and the build guide. You bring the tools and a weekend.

**The result?**
- A custom camper that costs 70% less
- Weighs half as much (~150 lbs vs 300+ lbs)
- Can be modified to fit your exact needs
- Taught you how it works (because you built it)

**Engineering specs:**
- Material: 6063-T5 aluminum extrusion
- Sleeping area: 72" × 60" (Queen)
- Collapsed height: 12" (30cm)
- Raised height: 48" (122cm)

**Open-source philosophy:**
We include full CAD files. Modify the design. Build add-ons. Share your improvements with the community. That's the Public Works way.
